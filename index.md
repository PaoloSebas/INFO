### Teaching Overview

I started my teaching career at the [National University of La Pampa (Argentina)](https://www.unlpam.edu.ar/) in April 2014. I worked at UNLPam until July 2019, when I moved to Australia with my family. As Subject Coordinator, I taught Physical Chemistry I and Introduction to Electromagnetism. I also worked as an Associate Lecturer in Physical Chemistry II, General Chemistry, and Physics III-Electromagnetism. 

Here in **Australia** I am working as Lecturer, at the [UOW](https://www.uow.edu.au/), for the subject Introduction to Environmental Physics.
