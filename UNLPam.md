Keyword: simply. 

Teaching is not simple, but it is wonderful. <br />

I spent more than three years at the National University of La Pampa (UNLPam) as Lecturer and Associate Lecturer in different subjects: General Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Electromagnetism, General Physics, Mathemathics. It was a challenging time, in another country with another language to learn but it was really beautiful. 

Here in Australia I had the opportunity to work as casual teacher at the UOW and now I am ready to see what is next!!
