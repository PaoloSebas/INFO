I was born in Latina, an italian city near Rome. I always had a passion for science. My highschool was a Scientific Liceo. After that I landed in the fabulous world of Chemistry science, at the [University of Rome Tor Vergata](https://en.uniroma2.it/). After an experience as Salesman for an Pharmaceutical Company, I moved to Alessandria (nort of Italy) to deepen my knowledge in Polymer Science and Technology. <br />

Love moves mountains, and I flew to Argentina to join my wife and have the gift to build a beautiful family. <br />

In Argentina I started the reasearch pathways in Atmospheric Physics and had the opportunity to work as Lecturer at the [University of La Pampa](http://www.unlpam.edu.ar/). <br />

Since my wife was granted a scholarship to do a PhD at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/), we moved in this marvelous city in July 2019. At the moment, I am a Postdoc fellow in the Molecular Photonics research group at the University of New South Wales. Environmental and Earth systems are becoming my new challenging fields of investigation.
