## Environmental and Earth Systems Science

Since my arrival in Australia in 2019, I had the priviledge of working with internationally renowned members of the Atmospheric Science community: Professor Scott KABLE (UNSW), Professor Meredith JORDAN (USYD), Professor Jenny FISHER (JCU), Professor Clare MURPHY and Nicholas DEUTSCHER (UOW). We collaborated to characterise novel atmospheric reaction mechanisms and assess their impact on the global atmospheric scenario using global transport models. At the moment, I am working on the formaldehyde photophysical oxidation (PPO) to assess its impact on the HO2 global budget.

## Atmospheric Physics

My goal is to make smaller and smaller the uncertainties related to the estimation of aerosol formation in global climate model simulations. Specifically, during my PhD in Atmospheric Physics, I studied molecular clusters pre-nucleation mechanisms by using DFT (Density Functional Theory). I also worked with colleagues from CNR-Italy on water molecular clusters formation and with the [Atmospheric Physics research group](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/investigaci%C3%B3n/%C3%A1reas-de-investigaci%C3%B3n/f%C3%ADsica-ofi/f%C3%ADsica-de-la-atm%C3%B3sfera/) of FaMAF-UNC (Cordoba-Argentina) to study Homogeneous Nucleation in Supercooled Liquid Water by Molecular Dynamics.

## Materials Science

I received my Bachelor degree (with Honours) in Chemistry carrying out an experimental thesis on the synthesis of a solid solution of magnesium, titanium and aluminium. The research project was in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and contemplated the use of Sol-Gel techniques. I got my Master's degree in Polymer Science and technology at the [Proplast](https://www.proplast.it/) (now [Plastic Academy](https://www.plasticsacademy.it/)) and my goal is to use this knowledge in the fields of materials recycling and waste management. 

## DATA SCIENCE

I am interested in applying Machine Learning (ML) to solve scientific problems. I finished a [Professional Program in Data Science](https://credentials.edx.org/records/programs/shared/a6ec23f56aa5460b96bf111bb9c2d6de/) with a [Capstone](https://github.com/PaoloSebas/DATA_SCIENCE/tree/main/CAPSTONE_CYO/GEOS_Chem) course applying ML algorithms to dataset produce by GEOS-Chem Simulations.
