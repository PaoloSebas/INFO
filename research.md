## Environmental and Earth Systems Science 

Since I arrived in Australia I had the opportunity to start collaborations with colleagues from three prestigious universities: UNSW, USyd and UOW. They are internationally renowned experts in different fields as, for example, global chemical transport modelling, atmospheric physical chemistry or paleoclimate. At the moment, I am performing Kinetic Modelling of a novel class of atmospheric reactions that will be used to improve the performance of global chemical transport models. 

Software and Codes: Multiwell, GEOS-Chem
Supercomputer: [GADI](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems)

## Atmospheric Physics 

My main goal is making smaller the uncertainties related to the estimation of aerosol (particulate) formation in global climate models. Specifically i am studying pre-nucleation mechanisms by DFT (Density Functional Theory) simulations. 

Software and Code: Gaussian, GAMESS, ORCA
