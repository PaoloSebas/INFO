## Environmental and Earth Science 

Since I arrived in Australia I had the opportunity to start collaborations with colleagues from three prestigious universities: UNSW, USyd and UOW. They are internationally renowned experts in different fields as, for example, global chemical transport modelling, atmospheric physical chemistry or paleoclimate. At the moment, I am performing Kinetic Modelling of a novel class of atmospheric reactions that will be used to improve the performance of global chemical transport models. 

Softwares and Codes: Multiwell, GEOS-Chem
