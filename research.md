## Environmental and Earth Systems Science

Since I arrived in Australia I had the opportunity to start collaborations with colleagues from three prestigious universities: UNSW, USyd and UOW. They are internationally renowned experts in different fields as, for example, global chemical transport modelling, atmospheric physical chemistry or paleoclimate. At the moment, I am performing Kinetic Modelling of a novel class of atmospheric reactions that will be used to improve the performance of global chemical transport models.

## Atmospheric Physics

My main goal is making smaller the uncertainties related to the estimation of aerosol formation in global climate models simulations. Specifically i am studying pre-nucleation mechanisms by DFT (Density Functional Theory). I am also working with colleagues from CNR-Italy on water molecular clusters formation and with the [Atmospheric Physics research group](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/investigaci%C3%B3n/%C3%A1reas-de-investigaci%C3%B3n/f%C3%ADsica-ofi/f%C3%ADsica-de-la-atm%C3%B3sfera/) of FaMAF-UNC (Cordoba-Argentina) to study Homogeneous Nucleation in Supercooled Liquid Water by Molecular Dynamics.

## Materials Science

I received my Master's degree in Chemistry carrying out an experimental thesis on the synthesis of a solid solution of magnesium, titanium and aluminium. The research project was in collaboration with Italian Space Agency (ASI) and contemplated that use of Sol-Gel techniques. I got my Master's degree in Polymer Science and technology at the [Proplast](https://www.proplast.it/) (now [Plastic Academy](https://www.plasticsacademy.it/)) and my goal is to use this knowledge in the fields of materials recycling and waste management. 

## DATA SCIENCE

I am interested in applying Machine Learning (ML) to the scientific problems I face during my work. Recently, I have finished a [Professional Program in Data Science](https://credentials.edx.org/records/programs/shared/a6ec23f56aa5460b96bf111bb9c2d6de/) with a [Capstone](https://github.com/PaoloSebas/DATA_SCIENCE/tree/main/CAPSTONE_CYO/GEOS_Chem) course applying ML algorithms to a dataset produce by GEOS-Chem Simulations.
